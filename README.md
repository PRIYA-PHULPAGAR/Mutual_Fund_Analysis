Mutual Fund Analysis

# Objective

 The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of various mutual funds over time. It examines key financial metrics such as Net Asset Value (NAV), returns, expense ratios, and risk levels. The analysis helps in understanding fund performance trends, the impact of expense ratios on returns, and risk distribution among funds.

# Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing mutual fund details, including:

Date: Timestamp of recorded data

Fund: Name of the mutual fund

NAV: Net Asset Value

Expense Ratio (%): Percentage of fund assets used for expenses

Return (%): Percentage return over a specific period

Risk Level: Categorization of risk (Low, Medium, High)

# Installation & Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

*pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Usage

*Load the dataset using Pandas.

*Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and distributions.

*Visualize key metrics such as NAV trends, return distributions, and risk categorization.

*Analyze relationships, such as Expense Ratio vs. Returns, using scatter plots.

# Key Features

*NAV Trend Analysis: Line plots displaying NAV changes over time.

*Expense Ratio vs. Returns: Scatter plot to analyze the impact of expense ratios on returns.

*Return Distribution: Boxplot for return variations among funds.

*Risk Level Analysis: Distribution of funds based on risk levels.
